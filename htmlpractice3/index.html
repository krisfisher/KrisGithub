<h1 style="color:blue"align="center";>Welcome to Lamoni, IA</h1>

<body style="background-color:tan;">

<p style="color:blue"align="center";> I moved to Lamoni,IA in 2017 I came to coach the wrestling to with my childhood bestfriend <br>
along with coaching i came to get my bachelors degree in social media marketing.  So far while <br>
in Lamoni I have have throughly enjoyed the small town vibes.  Being in a town that is not only <br>
has everything you need but also gives yout the calm and queit feeling that allow you to relax <br>
and let go.  One downside that I have noticed doesn't really have anything to do with the town<br>
but more its odd location compared to my home town meaning their really isn't a easy path to my<br>
home town.  But even with that the location is ideal in the fact that it is relatively close to<br>
to both Des Moines, IA and Kansas City, MO.  So with all things said I would say Lamoni is a great<br>
community with amazing people.</p>
