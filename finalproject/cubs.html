Off-Season of Magic?<br>
After a season where the Cubs fell short of repeating their history breaking World series win the Cubs<br>
went into the off-season with focusing on improving their pitching staff but not over spending to get talent<br>
the Cubs perfected this by not only getting the best starting pitcher in free agency in Yu Darvish they also<br>
added a lot of veteran talent in bullpen by signing Brandon Morrow.  With these two key acquisitions it puts<br>
the Cubs into contention of having the best starting rotation in baseball but also gives them the flexibility <br>
to go out after this season and maybe break the media by signing someone like Bryce Harper who has been rumored<br>
to want to join the Cubs and play along side Kris Bryant who he played with in High School together. So needless <br>
to say but Cubs fans should be happy about the talent on the roster and the possibility of the talent that will <br>
be added in the possible future all while being able to compete and possible win another World Series this season. <br>

Is Baez a MVP?<br>
With the season starting even though the weather has yet to agree that it is baseball season yet, but the Cubs are <br>
back at it.  The season has had a lot of rain outs and cold games so far so cant really decide what I think they <br>
will look like or what are off-season acquisitions will do and where that puts us compared to other teams.<br>
But is it to soon to say that Javy Baez has truly came around as a hitter a man who is known for swinging at<br>
everything without looking and without coming close has truly put the lumber on the ball this season.  Yes I<br>
know it is early on in the year but to think about it as the best defender period in baseball possible does <br>
he really need to be the best offensively to make a case for the MVP.  I am going you here and allow you to think<br>
on that but remember I said it first but if he ends up slumping forget i said it.
