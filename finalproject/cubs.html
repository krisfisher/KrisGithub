<p class=content> After a season where the Cubs fell short of repeating their history breaking World series win the Cubs<br>
went into the off-season with focusing on improving their pitching staff but not over spending to get talent<br>
the Cubs perfected this by not only getting the best starting pitcher in free agency in Yu Darvish they also<br>
added a lot of veteran talent in bullpen by signing Brandon Morrow.  With these two key acquisitions it puts<br>
the Cubs into contention of having the best starting rotation in baseball but also gives them the flexibility <br>
to go out after this season and maybe break the media by signing someone like Bryce Harper who has been rumored<br>
to want to join the Cubs and play along side Kris Bryant who he played with in High School together. So needless <br>
to say but Cubs fans should be happy about the talent on the roster and the possibility of the talent that will <br>
be added in the possible future all while being able to compete and possible win another World Series this season. <br>
