Will This Season be a Wake-up Call?<br>
The Chicago Blackhawks had by far the worst season in the last 10 seasons and its not even close.<br>
After multiple seasons of being bouunced in the first rounds of the playoffs the blackhawks <br>
decided that they needed to make the team younger and cheaper and with that their was the <br>
possibility of a bad season or two in route to being a younger and more sustainable  <br>
team after being strapped for cap space and not reaching the goals of the team.  Which <br>
would be winning it all. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Moving Forward<br>
The future is bright the Blackhawks had a rookie contribute for the first time in almost the entire<br>
Joel Quennevillie era he is an old school guy who is not know for giving rookies any signifigant playing<br>
time.  On top of that they still have one of the most prolific scorers of our time in Patrick Kane, who <br>
was just named to be the captain of team USA this summer.  We also have a great on and off ice leader<br>
in Jonathon Toews, who also happens to still be one of the top centers on ice.  Not to mention<br>
Duncan Keith who is one of the best defenders in the league.  But the rel problem is can we get <br>
rid of all the over priced mid tier players and somehow dump the huge cap hits of the aging players<br>
that no longer can compete at a high level.  Moving forward it will be great to see what magic Stan <br>
Bowman can creat because he certainly has done a great job in the past, so even after a terrible season <br>
I still have great faith in our organization.<br>
