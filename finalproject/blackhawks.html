<p class=content> The Blackhawks had probably the worst season in the last 10 seasons. <br>
After multiple seasons of being bouunced in the first rounds of the playoffs the blackhawks <br>
decided that they needed to make the team younger and cheaper and with that their was the <br>
possibility of a bad season or two in route to being a younger and more sustainable  <br>
team after being strapped for cap space and not reaching the goals of the team.  Which <br>
would be winning it all.
