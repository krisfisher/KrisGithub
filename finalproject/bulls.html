<p class=content>The Bulls are currently in a sad point of their life line as a life long fan I have never had a time where I wanted <br>
to watch my team less then I currently do we are currently in the embrace the tank time and we arnt even that good at it. <br>
 It is so funny to me that while we are clearing tanking and as a team we have very few brightspots we still someone mess <br>
things up and win games that we have no business winning.  But enough of my rant about the team and how the management is terrible<br>
lets focus on the bright spots.  And that starts with Lauri Markkanen the finnish areil assuaaltist that happens to be seven <br>
foot and happens to be the first draft pick that we have gotten correct since Jimmy Butler.  The bottom line is we need some help<br>
around him we need to find more talent  and we need to find it soon in an NBA that is dominated currently by super teams having one <br>
good draft pick on your team will not even be enough to get you to the playoffs so we need to hit on one or two more guys in the <br>
upcoming draft as well.<br>

Looking forward even though I currently dont enjoy watching the product the bulls are putting on the court I continue to find<br>
myself looking up stats and highlights.  And currently it has me enjoying the style of offense Hoiberg is putting out<br>
on the court but yet still worries me that we are playing to good to get an impact player in the draft.  If the <br>
season ended today then we would have the 8th and the 20th picks in the draft. But we really needed to be in the top 3<br>
so we tanked this season sold everything off for nothing and we have a low top 10 draft pick.  We failed at tanking <br>
and that brings me to the real question if you tried to fail but you succeed what did you truly do? did you fail or <br>
did you succeed? <br>
