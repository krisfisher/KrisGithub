<p class=content>The Bulls are currently in a sad point of their life line as a life long fan I have never had a time where I wanted <br>
to watch my team less then I currently do we are currently in the embrace the tank time and we arnt even that good at it. <br>
 It is so funny to me that while we are clearing tanking and as a team we have very few brightspots we still someone mess <br>
things up and win games that we have no business winning.  But enough of my rant about the team and how the management is terrible<br>
lets focus on the bright spots.  And that starts with Lauri Markkanen the finnish areil assuaaltist that happens to be seven <br>
foot and happens to be the first draft pick that we have gotten correct since Jimmy Butler.  The bottom line is we need some help<br>
around him we need to find more talent  and we need to find it soon in an NBA that is dominated currently by super teams having one <br>
good draft pick on your team will not even be enough to get you to the playoffs so we need to hit on one or two more guys in the <br>
upcoming draft as well.
