<p class=content> The Chicago Bears have had a very eventful off-season after a competitively terrible season <br>
they first started by firing John Fox and then hiring the offensive coordinator from the Chiefs, Matt Nagy. <br>
Matt Nagy is known for his innovative offense as well as being a quarterback whisper.  After Ryan Pace grabbed <br>
his coach of the future to go along with the quarterback he drafted last year he went to work on the free agents <br>
of this class were he signed WR Allen Robinson.  Who has been a staple in the jaguars offense before going down to <br>
to a ACL injury in the first week of the first play of last season.<br>
