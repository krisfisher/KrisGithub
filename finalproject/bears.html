<p class=content> The Chicago Bears have had a very eventful off-season after a competitively terrible season <br>
they first started by firing John Fox and then hiring the offensive coordinator from the Chiefs, Matt Nagy. <br>
Matt Nagy is known for his innovative offense as well as being a quarterback whisper.  After Ryan Pace grabbed <br>
his coach of the future to go along with the quarterback he drafted last year he went to work on the free agents <br>
of this class were he signed WR Allen Robinson.  Who has been a staple in the jaguars offense before going down to <br>
to a ACL injury in the first week of the first play of last season.<br>

The Bears are coming into the first year of a new coach and to me as a super fan I am extremely excited for the <br>
possible erection of the offense that Nagy brings.  With multiple options out of the back field on top of having <br>
a top tier WR now along with soon to be brought back first round draft pick Kevin White from IR.  Moving forward with <br>
with the future of our offense it appears that the signing of a new TE and the growing skill set of Adam Shaheen.<br>
Another interesting aspect moving forward is what will Vic do with the defense and how will he make it continue <br>
to get better and who will we have to rush the passer with so many different players being released and so few<br>
new players being brought in it appears we are looking to make an impact with our current roster and possible <br>
draft so young guys early in the draft.<br>
